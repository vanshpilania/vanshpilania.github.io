          <h2>My Web Developer Journey</h2>
          <p>
            I began learning Python when I was back in India, but I left it in between because I didn’t feel that it was made for me. When I came to Canada, I started learning again as I had an assignment that required building a website. I started with the basics of HTML, along with a bit of JavaScript and CSS, for which I took tutorials on how to make websites. While I'm not deeply into learning this yet, I somehow managed to create a working website.
