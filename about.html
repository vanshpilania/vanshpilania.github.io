          This page provides information about my background and education.

        <p>
          Hello! My name is Vansh Pilania, originally from Hisar, Haryana,
          India. I completed my high school education at O.P. Jindal Modern
          School in Hisar. Currently, I am pursuing an Associate of Science
          degree at Capilano University. I am dedicated and diligent, exploring different paths to find what's right for me. I got into coding because I thought it was cool, and I’m currently in the early stages of learning and discovering where it might lead me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I came to Canada to gain foreign exposure and experience different cultures, something that wouldn't have been possible in India. I enjoy going on short trips and exploring new places. Currently, I’m considering a career in web development, but I recognize that the competition is tough, so I’m also exploring other options. Alongside my studies, I’m working part-time in a restaurant, which requires me to balance my academic responsibilities with my job. While the journey has its challenges, I’m embracing every moment as a chance to grow and learn. I’m optimistic about the future and believe that with determination and an open mind, I’ll find the path that’s truly right for me.
