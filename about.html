          Hello! My name is Vansh Pilania, originally from Hisar, Haryana,
          India. I completed my high school education at O.P. Jindal Modern
          School in Hisar. Currently, I am pursuing an Associate of Science
          degree at Capilano University. I am dedicated and diligent, with a
          clear focus on my future goal of becoming a Full Stack Developer. My
          journey is fueled by a passion for technology and innovation, and I am
          committed to developing the skills necessary to excel in the dynamic
          field of software development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am passionate about web development because it combines creativity
          with problem-solving in a way that constantly challenges and excites
          me. The field offers endless opportunities to innovate and make
          impactful changes, whether it's improving user experience, increasing
          accessibility, or creating dynamic, responsive websites that serve a
          variety of needs. Every project is a chance to learn something new and
          push the boundaries of what technology can achieve. Additionally, the
          prospect of building solutions that millions can access and benefit
          from fuels my enthusiasm and dedication to mastering this craft.
